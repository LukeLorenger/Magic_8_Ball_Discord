Hello, 

Welcome to my code. This Python file randomly generates a response when you enter certain commands. It works like a "Magic 8 Ball". 
Commands = ! + ["8b", "8ball", "eightb", "eb"] = (!8b)

Example of Use:
!8b magic 8 ball, will I make it to work on time? (enter)

Returns a random (yes/no) type response to "answer" that question for you. 

This application is designed to work within the "Discord" app, it requires a "channel key" to connect to your channel. The bot can then be hosted on the selected
discord channel.
